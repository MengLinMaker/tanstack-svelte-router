# Tanstack Svelte Router - SvelteHack 2024

A port of the Tanstack React Router to Svelte 5 with runes.

But why? - summarised from [Tanner Linsley's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlCxEjxprKg):

- Typesafe routes and query params to prevent dynamic bugs
- Url param state management and caching
- Prefetching links so pages appear to load fast

_Note: We intend to contribute this upstream to Tanstack Router._
